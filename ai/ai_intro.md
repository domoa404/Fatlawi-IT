# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
### A simple overview covering:
- Machine Intelligence
- Weak AI vs Strong AI
- Machine Learning Basics


## 1. Machine Intelligence
Machines can mimic humans in:
Talking, Thinking, Learning, Planning, Understanding.

Also called:
- Machine Intelligence
- Computer Intelligence

## 2. Weak AI (Narrow AI)
- Simulates human intelligence
- Works in specific areas

Examples:
Email spam filters, Text-to-Speech, Self-driving cars, Google Maps, NLP, Siri, Alexa.

## 4. Machine Learning
Traditional programming:
Data + Algorithms = Results

Machine learning:
Data + Results = Algorithms
